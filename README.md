The main goal in the scenario of this project is to create a website which will present best movies according to IMDB database.
The movies data will be retrieve by requests to an API which already exists. The design of the website must be inspired from Netflix design.

Objectives of the project:
    - Assimilate the basics of front end languages
    - Develop a user interface for a python web application
    - Interact with a REST API and manage asynchronous requests

# I. Install loval version of the API

Go to the GitHub page of the API and follow the instructions to clone the code repository and start the server locally

    $ https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR

# II. Launch the website

Once you launched the API server locally, you can launch the website JustStreamIt by opening the file index.html with your navigator.

The website is designed to be compatible with the main browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

Once on the website, you can select any movie to open a modal window which will present all detailed informations about it.

Following the scenario, three categories and seven movies per category are presented.
